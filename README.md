CSCI 2270 Final Project
This program creates a "smart" wish list that will help people store items they are
are interested in buying, where to purchase the item, and how much it costs. 
The program will allow the user to add items to the list, delete items from the 
list and compare similar items, ultimately helping the user decide what to 
purchase. Once the user is done making their wish list, their list can be saved
to a text file. The data in this program will be stored in a hash table since,
items that are the same will be stored at the same index, even though their
supplier and price may differ. This will make it easier for comparison between
items, based on who sells it and how much it costs.
